# PageTurner chat - a full-stack customer support chatbot

I followed a project to learn modern full-stack development using the latest tech stack, created by Josh, a software developer whose work can be found on his YouTube channel at https://www.youtube.com/@joshtriedcoding. I want to credit him for being a good developer and a mentor for sharing his expertise within the community of programming.
